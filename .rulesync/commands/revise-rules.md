Review this session for learnings about this codebase. Update `.rulesync/rules/` files with context that would help future AI agent sessions be more effective.

**Important:** This project uses rulesync. The source of truth is `.rulesync/rules/`, not `CLAUDE.md`. After editing, run `rulesync generate` to regenerate derived files.

## Step 1: Reflect

What context was missing that would have helped the AI agent work more effectively?

- Bash commands that were used or discovered
- Code style patterns followed
- Testing approaches that worked
- Environment/configuration quirks
- Warnings or gotchas encountered

## Step 2: Find Rule Files

The rule files live under `.rulesync/rules/`:

| File       | Scope |
| ---------- | ----- |
| `rules.md` | Index |

Decide which file each addition belongs to based on scope.

## Step 3: Draft Additions

**Keep it concise** - one line per concept. These rules are part of the prompt, so brevity matters.

Format: `<command or pattern>` - `<brief description>`

Avoid:

- Verbose explanations
- Obvious information
- One-off fixes unlikely to recur

## Step 4: Show Proposed Changes

For each addition:

```
### Update: .rulesync/rules/<file>.md

**Why:** [one-line reason]

\`\`\`diff
+ [the addition - keep it brief]
\`\`\`
```

## Step 5: Apply with Approval

Ask if the user wants to apply the changes. Only edit files they approve.
After approval, remind to run `rulesync generate`.
